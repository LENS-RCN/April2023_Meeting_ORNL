This tutorial focuses on integrating multiple National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) data sources to examine how edge effects might influence biodiversity patterns in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park (GRSM) NEON site.

## Learning Objectives
1. Participants will learn how to visualize spatial data representing features of NEON sites (i.e., elevation rasters, lines representing roads, and points indicating organismal plot locations) in R.
2. Participants will learn about NEON organismal data for sentinel taxa and how to access those data in the ecocomDP format in R using the NEONdivdata package.
3. Participants will formulate hypotheses about how edge effects may influence biodiversity at NEON sites and explore these hypotheses with analyses on the relationships between distance from road and species richness of various sentinel taxa.

# Context 
Fragmentation is the disruption of continuity in pattern or process. Across the globe, human activity has resulted in habitat fragmentation to varying degrees. For instance, the creation of roads for transportation creates a mosaic of fragmented patches of habitat. Environmental conditions differ closer to the edge of a road relative to areas further from a road where there is intact habitat within a patch. This phenomenon of differing conditions at the transition zone between the road and intact habitat away from the road is known more generally as an edge effect. In this tutorial, we will explore how edge effects caused by roads within a NEON site influence species richness of NEON's sentinel taxa.

[NEON](https://www.neonscience.org/) is comprised of 81 terrestrial and aquatic sites spanning the contiguous United States, Puerto Rico, Alaska, and Hawaii distributed across twenty eco-climatic domains. NEON uses standardized protocols to collect a variety of observations at each site ranging from information on the flux of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere above sites to the number of small mammals scurrying around on the ground. Although NEON collects a great deal of information at each site, very little information on human land use and management is collected by the Observatory. However, remote sensing data collected by the NEON Airborne Observation Platform (AOP), a low-flying plane equipped with various sensors and cameras, have the potential to provide some information on land use at the sites (Ordway et al. 2021). For instance, the NEON AOP collects remotely sensed information using a **Li**ght **D**etection **A**nd **R**anging (LiDAR or active scanning) sensor that can be used to reconstruct a high-resolution (1-m) topographic map of the each site. Such LiDAR derived data have been used by archaeologists to detect artefacts across landscape scales (Johnson & Oiumet 2014).

Recent work by the Record research group at Bryn Mawr College and the University of Maine generated spatial data layers (shapefiles) of roads across all NEON sites leveraging the NEON AOP LiDAR data. During this process, roads and stream data layers provided by the United States Census and National Hydrological Databases, respectively, were overlaid onto a high-resolution (i.e., 1-m) digital elevation model hillshade map generated from the NEON LiDAR data and then shapefiles of undetected roads (e.g., dirt roads) were made (Figure 1).

Today we will explore how to incorporate this information on roads at NEON sites into an analysis investigating relationships between NEON organismal observations and edge effects focused on the Great Smoky Mountain National Park (GRSM) site. Let's first load in the GRSM LiDAR derived road layer and the NEON terrestrial sampling boundaries.
